### What is Terraform?
- It is a tool for managing our IT resources using code. You use Terraform to process a configuration file you have prepared that details the desired state of your infrastructure. Terraform then creates/updates to set up that desired state.
- Terraform is one of the most popular tools used for infrastructure as code (IaC), which is a way to manage your IT infrastructure. Instead of manually managing resources using the console or text commands in CLI, IaC automates with code.
- Terraform uses configuration files to to define and manage infrastructure. These files describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform figures out how to achieve that state. 
- Main.tf is where you write down what you want your infrastructure to look like, using Terraform's language. Think of it as the blueprint for building your cloud resources.
